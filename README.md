## Conclusion:

This analysis of global weather patterns from 1929 to the present reveals several key trends:

* **Global Precipitation Trends:** The average amount of precipitation worldwide each year seems to have leveled off recently, with no major increases or decreases overall or in any particular season. There was a small drop of 0.01 inches over the last 5 years compared to the 5 years before that. However, if we look at the big picture, the total amount of precipitation each year around the globe has been steadily going up since 2000.

* **US Precipitation Trends:** In the US, there's been a slight increase in the average yearly rainfall for Spring, Summer, and Winter.  Over the past 5 years, the average hasn't changed compared to the 5 years before that. Just like the global trend, the US has also experienced a noticeable increase in total yearly precipitation since 2000.

* **Global Warming Trend:** The average temperature around the world is slowly but steadily rising, without any unusual changes from season to season. 

* **USA Temperature Convergence:** While the US saw a drop in temperatures, it's now in a similar range (50-60Â°F) to the global average. No major seasonal temperature swings were observed in the US either.

* **Extreme Weather Events Escalating:** The number of all types of extreme weather events is on the rise both globally and in the USA. However, the increase is happening a bit slower in the USA. Heatwaves are the most common extreme event in the USA, while strong winds are more frequent globally. 

* **Intensity Divergence:** Interestingly, while the intensity of extreme weather events has been decreasing globally, with a particular decrease noted in strong winds within the USA, the overall intensity has actually been increasing within the USA.

### Challenges and Methodologies:

* **Data Quality and Completeness:** The visuals hint that the data recorded before 1970 may be less reliable due to limitations in data collection and recording practices at that time. Even though invalid entries were filtered out based on NOAA GSOD guidelines, the accuracy and completeness of older records might still be affected. This highlights the importance of either checking the findings against other data sources or focusing the analysis on data from 1970 onwards. This will help ensure any conclusions drawn about long-term trends are accurate.

* **Data Aggregation and Visualization:** Analyzing data from thousands of weather stations worldwide posed challenges due to the sheer volume of data and the need to create easily understandable visuals. To improve clarity and efficiency, the data was grouped by country (or state, when focusing on the USA). Visualizations were created to present this complex information in a clear and concise manner.

* **Defining Extreme Weather Events:** To pinpoint extreme weather events, established criteria were used to set thresholds for temperature, precipitation, and wind speed. While a heatwave is often defined as three or more consecutive days at or above 90 degrees, a more conservative threshold of 95 degrees was chosen to ensure accuracy. Heavy rain was classified as 3 inches or more in a single day, and strong winds as those exceeding 40 MPH.

* **Python for Automation and Flexibility:** Python helped streamline everything, making it easy to run SQL queries, handle the data, and create those visuals. This means the analysis can be easily adapted to focus on different regions or time periods, even zooming in on a specific state within the US if desired.

### Recommendations and Future Work / TODO:

* **Cross-Validate with Additional Datasets:** Incorporate data from other sources to verify and strengthen the findings of this analysis.
* **Deeper Regional Analysis:** Dig even deeper into the data, examining weather patterns and trends at the state, county, or even city level. Spotting local anomolies or patterns as compared to a large scale, potentially discovering areas with concerning patterns.
* **Investigate Underlying Causes:** Explore potential factors driving the observed trends, such as greenhouse gas emissions, deforestation, or natural climate cycles.
* **Predict Future Trends:** Utilize advanced statistical modeling or machine learning techniques to forecast future weather patterns and their potential impacts.
* **Dig Deeper into Rainfall:** Take a closer look at rainfall patterns, including droughts, unusual events, and how things differ from one region to another. Create visuals to highlight areas with strange or worrisome rainfall trends.
* **Connect the Dots:** Bring together all the charts and graphs from the analysis to see if any patterns emerge. For instance, we might notice that a year with less rainfall also saw higher temperatures and more heatwaves.

This project gives us a good look at what's happening with the weather around the world, showing us both worrying changes and areas where we need to do more research. By using the approaches outlined here and tackling the problems we've identified, future studies can build on this work and help us better understand our changing climate so we can find ways to deal with it.
